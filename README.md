My version of Conway's Game of Life using SFML/C++

# Simulation Instructions
There is a precompiled version for x64 based windows systems in the x64 folder.
Currently, there is no way to change the internal resolution as it is constant in the source.  If you want to change it, you'll need to edit the source and recompile it.
This version does not require SFML dlls to be in the directory with the executable.

Upon starting, the simulation will be paused.  You can draw cells with the Left mouse button, erase cells with the Right mouse button, and toggle pause with the Space key.  You can close the simulation using the Window GUI Close button (The X in the top right corner).
